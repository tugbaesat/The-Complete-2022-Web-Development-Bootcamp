# Dicee Challenge

## About the Project: 📚
This project is created to practise JavaScript skills in the scope of "The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp". In this project the aim is to create a website that you can roll two dices and the numbers are randomly appointed to dices. The player who has greater value wins. The equality case is also considered.
